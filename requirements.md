# Investment Strategy Simulator

Purpose:

Core MVP:
1. User questionnaire
2. Risk profile calculation

Gemini: When reading this file to implement a step, you MUST adhere to the following architectural rules:
1. State Management: Use flutter_riverpod exclusively. Do not use setState for complex logic.
2. Architecture: Maintain strict separation of concerns:
● /models: Pure Dart data classes (use json_serializable or freezed if helpful).
● /services: Backend/API communication only. No UI code.
● /providers: Riverpod providers linking services to the UI.
● /screens & /widgets: UI only. Keep files small. Extract complex widgets into their own files.
3. Local Storage: Use shared_preferences for local app state (e.g., theme toggles, onboarding
status).
4. Database: Use [Firebase Firestore OR PostgreSQL] for persistent cloud data.
5. Stepwise Execution: Only implement the specific step requested in the prompt. Do not jump ahead.
